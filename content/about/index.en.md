Hey, there! 👋

I'm Ana, a brazilian Software Developer (pero mexicana de corazón) based in Mexico City 🇲🇽.

I currently work as a Developer Advocate at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), engaging with developers and helping them make the best use of the cloud. ☁️

Prior to joining AWS, I was a Software Development Engineer at Amazon.com and spent some time working at startups. I also hold an M.S. in Computer Science from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) and a B.S. in Information Systems from [PUCRS](https://www.pucrs.br/).

I'm passionate about [video games](https://psnprofiles.com/cunhaana), [craft beers](https://untappd.com/user/anacunha), [Taylor Swift](https://last.fm/user/anamcunha), coffee ☕, and now tacos (con salsa de la que pica) 🌮.
